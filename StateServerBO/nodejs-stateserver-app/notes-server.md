<!-- 1. const express = require('express'); -->

This line imports the express module, which is the core module for creating web applications with Node.js using the Express.js framework.

<!-- 2. const app = express(); -->

This line creates an instance of the Express application. I use this app object to define routes, handle requests, and configure this web server.

<!-- 3. const port = 3000; -->

Here, I define a variable port and set it to 3000. This specifies the port on which my Node.js server will listen for incoming HTTP requests. This can change this to any available port.

<!-- 4. const fs = require('fs');` -->

This line imports the fs module, which stands for "File System." It's a core module in Node.js that provides functionality for reading and writing files, including reading JSON files.

<!-- 5. const pointInPolygon = require('point-in-polygon'); // Install this library using `npm install point-in-polygon` -->

This line imports the point-in-polygon library. point-in-polygon is a third-party library that allows us to determine whether a point is inside a polygon. You need to install this library using npm, as indicated in the comment. It's used in the code to check whether a set of coordinates falls within the borders of a state.

<!-- 6. const statesData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./states.json', 'utf8')); -->

This line reads and parses the contents of the states.json file. It uses the fs module to read the file and then uses JSON.parse to convert the file's content into a JavaScript object. The resulting object, statesData, contains the state data, including the state borders (polygons).

<!-- 7. app.use(express.static('public')); -->

Here, I set up a middleware to serve static files, such as HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript, from the public directory (folder). This is a common practice to serve static assets in Express.

<!-- 8. app.get('/getState', (req, res) => {
    const latitude = parseFloat(req.query.latitude);
    const longitude = parseFloat(req.query.longitude);

    const state = statesData.find((stateData) => {
        const border = stateData.border;
        return pointInPolygon([longitude, latitude], border);
    });

    if (state) {
        res.json({ state: state.state });
    } else {
        res.json({ state: 'Not Found' });
    }
}); -->

This section defines a route at /getState. When this route is accessed, it extracts the latitude and longitude from the query parameters in the request (req.query.latitude and req.query.longitude). It then uses the pointInPolygon library to find the state that corresponds to the provided coordinates. If a state is found, it sends a JSON response with the state's name. If no state is found, it sends a response with "Not Found."

<!-- 9. app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
}); -->

Finally, this line starts the Express server and listens on the specified port (in this case, port is set to 3000). When the server is running, it logs a message to the console indicating the server's URL.
